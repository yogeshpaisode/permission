                    <div class="alert alert-info">Q: When I went to request the sample it said they were out or that I didn’t qualify to get the sample.</div>
                    <div class="alert alert-danger">Answer:<br>We sometimes offer exclusive free samples through allyou.com, but often we are scouting out other free samples being offered by other companies. Since most of these samples have no affiliation with All You, we make sure to the best of our ability the requesting process is simple and strait-forward before we post the sample. We want you to trust the sites we find and know they are legitimate, however, since these are not All You sites, we cannot control the quantity of samples, length of the offer or changes to the qualifications for receiving the sample after we post our daily find.</div>
                    <br>

                    <div class="alert alert-info">Q: The free sample site won't work for me.</div>
                    <div class="alert alert-danger">Answer:<br>Sometimes theses sites are built with a program called Flash or may have pop-up windows (or both). Make sure you have the Macromedia Flash plug in (it’s a free update that most newer browsers come with, but not all) and you do not block pop-up windows.</div>
                    <br>

                    <div class="alert alert-info">Q: I don't want give my phone number to request a sample.</div>
                    <div class="alert alert-danger">Answer:<br>Most sample sites we promote don't require a phone number but occasionally they do. You should only give the personal information you feel comfortable providing.</div>
                    <br>

                    <div class="alert alert-info">Q: When I visit the free sample calendar it still says “Check back soon for today's free sample”- Why is that?</div>
                    <div class="alert alert-danger">Answer:<br>If you are seeing the "Check back soon" message it is because we either have not yet posted today’s sample find or your Internet browser has saved that image on your computer. Browsers often do this to increase their speed and efficiency for websites you visit often. We post a daily free sample find every morning between 9 and 10 AM. If you still see the “Check back” message at that time, try refreshing your Internet browser or close your browser completely then reopen it again.</div>
                    <br>

                    <div class="alert alert-info">Q: I don't want to have my email inbox overrun with newsletters, offers and possibly spam.</div>
                    <div class="alert alert-danger">Answer:<br>We suggest opening a free email account (through Yahoo or Gmail) to use just for entering online sweeps and requesting free samples.</div>
                    <br>

                    <div class="alert alert-info">Q: I can’t see the free sample calendar.</div>
                    <div class="alert alert-danger">Answer:<br>If you cannot see the free sample calendar at all, it may be because you do not have JavaScript enabled in your browser’s preferences. You can change this in your browser set up.</div>
